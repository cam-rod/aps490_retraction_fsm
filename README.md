# Capstone FSM proototype

This is a logic prototype of an FSM being used in my capstone project. The code
doesn't actually run â€” the main focus was on verifying the design of the FSM,
and practicing some Rust along the way (especially the
[proc-macro](retract_fsm_transition/src/lib.rs) I put together).
